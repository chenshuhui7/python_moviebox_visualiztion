# python_moviebox_visualiztion
a program that about : crawling  the box office website-"http://58921.com/alltime/" to get a lot of movies data and then do the visualized analysis  by pyecharts version 0.5.5 (because i can't use the newest one V1,they have some difference and incompatible )

my summary:
don't climb this site unless you have Baidu Cloud paid image recognition API ,because the box office data is stored in the form of pictures!! the box-office value of films has increased several times in the past decade by comparing 2010、2011、2018、2019 with the rapid development of Chinese economy and influenced by the epidemic,the box office of 2020 is very poor.


my projects include spyder.py(爬数据，保存为csv表格，但是票房是图片格式，需要手动更改票房数据，或者调用百度云图片文字识别api） and analysis.py(生成可视化网页）
